# Project: User Wait

## Introduction

Laptop is now one of the most important tool we have for our daily work.
But we have no idea how to collect important information such as battery usage
in our laptop. This project will give us a hands on experience how to collect
these information. For this check point we understand and create basic Intel telemetry edge agent
to collect these information.

## Running the project

- To get the data run the following command line located inside run.py file.
  This will call specific dll files to collect the data regard to your laptop.

- To get the data, from the project root dir, you should see the data folder.
  Inside the data folder, you should see a new database file being generated.

## Type Of Data

- The db file generate from 4 different dll files provided by Intel team.
  Each dll collect different types of the information regards to the device.
- For the next checkpoint we will design and implement our own collector.
  This collector will be similar to the one provided by Intel team.

## Responsibility

- This is an independent assignment
